An app to help memorize, understand, and internalize *Nitnem* (the Sikh daily prayers) and more *Gurbani*

## Concepts
### Skills/Badges
When memorizing *Gurbani*, there are several aspects that, when individually worked on and stored, come together to form a clearer picture of the *Shabad* in your mind. This in turn helps you to grasp what you are reciting. Memorize Gurbani helps you to work on a number of these per *Bani* and, when tested, you receive a badge for achieving a perfect score.

* **Pauree Order Badge** - Put all sections/*Paurees* in the correct order for the *Bani*
* **Line Order Badge** - Put all lines in the correct order for the *Bani*
* **Padchhed Badge** - Put spaces in the correct places in all lines for the *Bani*
* **Maatra Badge** - Put all the *Maatra* in the correct places in all lines for the *Bani*
* **Visraam Badge** - Put short and long pauses in the correct places in all lines for the *Bani*
* **Meaning Badge** - Choose the correct translation for all lines in the *Bani*

### Publisher
While only the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabandhak Committee has permission to print full *Saroops* of Dhan Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, there are *Panthik* publishers of *Gutkas* and *Pothis* (who also use authentic historical sources) that may have differences in spelling and/or *Padchhed*. While my *Ardaas* is that all publishers come together to come to one standard, the aim of Memorize Gurbani is to make these different versions available (as data becomes available) in order to serve the most *Sangat*.

### Length
Throughout the entire *Panth*, *Sangat* chooses or has been given *Hukam* to recite some compiled *Banis* at different lengths. Some more popular ones are available as data becomes available. For the purpose of clarity and avoiding ambiguity, these are labeled as *Jathebandi*/institution names. This is not intented to serve as a point of division.
